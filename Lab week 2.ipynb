    "A variable is a container storing a value. Contrary to other programming languages R does not have a command for declaring a variable, but instead a variable is created once a value is assigned to it. This can be done by using the assignment operator (i.e. `<-` or `=`). The variable name must start with a letter and can contain numbers and letters as well as the special characters underscore('_') and period('.'). Other special characters including white space (' ') are not allowed in variable names.\n",

If you look to the right on that same toolbar you will notice that this cell here is a \"Markdown\" cell. We use Markdown cells to type texts within a jupyter notebook file. The following cell is a \"code\" cell in which we will perform all the R programming."
