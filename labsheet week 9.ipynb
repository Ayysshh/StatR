A classic and solid approach to point estimate the population mean is to calculate the sample mean and take that value as a point estimation. We have calculated sample means many times throughout this lab and discovered that they get closer to the population mean as the sample size increases. Essentially you can assume those estimates to be \"good\" guesses of the population mean, sometimes also referred to as the \"true mean\". \n",
